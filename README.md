# Karun Japhet

Engineering Leader and consultant at [@sahajsoft](https://github.com/sahajsoft). I work on large-scale systems, architecture, and AI-assisted software development.

## What I'm focused on

**AI-assisted engineering** — not just code generation, but the full lifecycle:
- Clarifying requirements with AI
- Using LLMs as architectural thinking partners  
- Debugging with structured prompting
- Improving delivery workflows with better tooling

I work mostly with Claude Code and GitHub Copilot, using prompt engineering, context engineering, and chain-of-thought scaffolding.

## Speaking

I speak at conferences about distributed systems, event-driven design, large-scale data engineering, ML for fraud detection, and AI's role in the software lifecycle.
