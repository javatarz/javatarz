# Karun Japhet

Engineering Leader and practitioner at [@sahajsoft](https://github.com/sahajsoft). I design and develop large-scale systems and work on AI-assisted software development.

## What I'm focused on

**AI-assisted engineering** — beyond code generation, the full lifecycle:
- Discovering and clarifying requirements with AI
- Reasoning through system design with LLMs  
- Debugging with structured prompting
- Improving delivery workflows with better tooling

I use Claude Code and GitHub Copilot, with prompt engineering, context engineering, and chain-of-thought scaffolding.

## Speaking

I speak at conferences about distributed systems, event-driven design, large-scale data engineering, ML for fraud detection, and AI's role in the software lifecycle.
